# C# LINQ Documentation

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful feature in C# that allows for querying data from different data sources using a uniform syntax. LINQ provides a set of standard query operators that enable you to query any collection implementing the `IEnumerable<T>` interface.

## Basic LINQ Query Syntax

The basic syntax for a LINQ query in C# is as follows:

```csharp
var query = from item in collection
            where condition
            select item;
```

- `from`: Specifies the data source.
- `where`: Filters the data based on a specified condition.
- `select`: Projects the data into a new form.

## LINQ Query Operators

LINQ provides a variety of query operators such as `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy`, `Join`, `Aggregate`, and more. These operators allow you to perform different operations on the data source.

```csharp
var result = collection.Where(x => x.Property > 10)
                       .OrderBy(x => x.Property)
                       .Select(x => x.Name);
```

## LINQ Method Syntax

In addition to the query syntax, LINQ also supports method syntax, which allows you to chain LINQ operators together using extension methods.

```csharp
var result = collection.Where(x => x.Property > 10)
                       .OrderBy(x => x.Property)
                       .Select(x => x.Name);
```

## Benefits of LINQ

- Provides a unified way to query different data sources.
- Increases code readability and maintainability.
- Supports deferred execution, allowing for optimized query performance.
